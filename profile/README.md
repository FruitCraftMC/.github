## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


# Welcome To OrbitMC Github Repositories!
this was initialy called fruitcraft but im not changing all my packages names for the rename so we package under `org.fruitcraft.com`

## Repos Here
going to talk about all the repos here with basicly a what they each do.

### [Banknotes](https://github.com/FruitCraftMC/Banknotes)
a lightweight banknote plugin developed in house. uses vaultAPI and has withdrawal and depositing logs. currency data is stored in the note and is not cross checked for speed but also is low security. (will be forked when high security is needed)

### [Bounty Hunter](https://github.com/FruitCraftMC/Bounty-Hunter)
The Bounty Hunter NPC in the game allows players to place and claim bounties on other players through a series of GUI menus. Players can view active bounties, place new bounties by providing the target player's name and the bounty amount, and claim bounties by turning in the killed player's head.

### MGLA Systems
MGLA stands for Mini Game Lobby Assist and basicly functions as a connector from it to the other MGLA plugins that contain games.

[MGLA](https://github.com/FruitCraftMC/MGLA) : manages the MGLA relelated Plugins.

#### MGLA Games
- [MGLA Boatracing](https://github.com/FruitCraftMC/MGLABoatRacing): a boatracing minigame with some cool functionality, was going to make a standalone version at somepoint.
- [MGLA TntRun](): in development, but really just TNT run.
